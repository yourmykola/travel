        description: 'Perri Spreiser worked her way from ecology-loving first-grader to park ranger at the Grand Canyon. But there’s more to being a ranger than trekking one of the most iconic natural wonders in the world, especially since the national park surpassed a record-breaking 6 million visitors in 2016. We talked to Spreiser about hidden side canyons, clueless visitors, and the job perk known as informal roving.',

        description: 'The only West Coast, oceanfront, steel roller coaster located on a Pier over the Pacific Coastline. Ocean sprays breeze by riders as they escalate to a height of 55 feet. The coaster provides spectacular views of the Santa Monica Bay and the Pacific Ocean as it trails from one end of the Park to the other at 35 mph. The West Coaster first debuted when Pacific Park opened in 1996 and has been a signature ride for the Park ever since. The coaster’s double-helix track has become an iconic profile for the Pier and is often featured in films, TV shows, and advertisements as a quintessential “amusement park” shape. Often silhouetted by the setting sun, the coaster’s iconic status for a seaside amusement park attraction is rivaled only by the classic, decades-old wooden coasters at Santa Cruz Beach Board Walk and Belmont Shores.',

You can expect cool weather and it might rain on you a bit if you get unlucky, but it should still be fairly pleasant.
